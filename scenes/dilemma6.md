# Description
At a recent team meeting, you addressed the handover of recurring tasks in connection to vacation and days off. Up until now you have taken it upon yourself to distribute the tasks, but now you want to delegate this responsibility to your team. At the meeting, the team reached the following agreement: a team member going on vacation, is responsible for handing over his/her recurring tasks to other team members. 

On your way to your desk on Thursday morning, you witness a heated discussion between your team members Lilli and John. They are both really upset. Lilli wants John to hand over his recurring tasks before he leaves for vacation tomorrow. John, who wasn't present at the team meeting, says that he doesn't consider that his responsibility. 

They both turn to you, as you enter the office. You have a meeting starting in 5 min. What do you do? 


# Choice
I tell them that we have to sort this out later today, since I have a meeting waiting. 
In the afternoon, John, Lilli and I sit down together so we can talk this disagreement through. I start by updating John on our agreement from the team meeting. Then I ask John to explain his version first, before asking Lilli to explain from her point of view. After hearing both sides, I ask John to make sure that his recurring tasks are handed over. 

 

# Feedback
 It's great that you take time to sit down and mediate the disagreement. This gives you the possibility to sort out the misunderstanding between the two team members. However, this disagreement might be a matter that you should handle right away, since their discussion could evolve from morning to afternoon and make it harder to resolve. 

This is a dilemma of setting direction while facilitating trust and relationships in the team and promoting a healthy and engaging work environment.  







# Choice
Lilli is right in this situation, so, on the spot I give John a super quick update on the agreement we made at the team meeting, where he wasn't present. I then ask him to hand over his recurring tasks before he leaves for vacation and head off to the meeting. Later I will follow up 1:1 with Lilli to investigate why the discussion ended in such a heated manner.


# Feedback
This choice reflects that you are making effective decisions. Yes, Lilli is right, but John wasn't informed. It might be a good idea to investigate why John and Lilli's discussion ended in such a heated manner - not just with Lilli. You may also consider to give John the update in a 1:1 talk instead.

This is a dilemma of setting direction while facilitating trust and relationships in the team and promoting a healthy and engaging work environment.  





# Choice
I suggest to John that we have a 1:1 talk right away, even though I'll be late for my meeting. I update John on the decision made at the team meeting and ask him to proactively follow up on any team meetings that he is absent from. If everybody had followed the new agreement, this heated discussion wouldn't have happened. 


# Feedback
It's good to sit down with John to update him and also doing it right away. His behaviour is based on lack of information, so remember this when you sit down with him. Asking him to proactively follow up on team meetings and hand over tasks are good decisions and ensure timely procedures. 

This is a dilemma of setting direction while facilitating trust and relationships in the team and promoting a healthy and engaging work environment.
