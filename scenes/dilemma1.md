# Description
Francisca has been working in your team for the past three years. She's highly skilled and the only one who knows how to manage a vital process in your team. 

Your team has been very busy this past year, so you haven't had a chance to plan how her knowledge is going to be shared with the rest of the team. 

During a 1:1 meeting, you are surprised to learn that Francisca wants to apply for a leadership position in a different part of the company. 

Based on your experience working with her, you don't think she'd be a good fit for a leadership role; she really struggles to delegate work and set direction. Francisca would like you to be her referral in the application process.

How do you respond?

# Choice
 I don’t think Francisca would thrive in a leadership role, but I acknowledge that this is something she wants to do. So I accept to be her referral. I also tell her that I need her to work with me and the team over the next three months to ensure that her knowledge about the vital process is transferred to the team. 

# Feedback
It's great that you're being supportive of Francisca's growth within the organisation, while also keeping the business' goals in mind. However, if you think that Francisca isn't fit for a leadership role you ought to have a conversation with her about her motivation to transition into leadership and be more frank about how you see her potential -or lack of potential - to become a leader. 

This is a dilemma of balancing how you develop your team members, provide sincere feedback and keep the business running.


# Choice
I decide to give Francisca my sincere feedback. I exemplify why I don't think she's ready yet and suggest that we develop a detailed 6-month development plan for her where she can get exposure to and training in the needed leadership skills. If she still wants to take on a leadership role after these six months, and has demonstrated growth, I will be happy to give her my full support and be her referral. Getting Francisca to stay in my team for a few more months would also buy me time to get the rest of the team more familiar with the vital process.    

# Feedback
Great decision. It's always good to be curious about your employees' development goals, and offer constructive and sincere feedback along the way. One possible challenge is that by committing to developing Francisca's leadership skills over the next six months you might reduce your team's productivity, as Francisca will not be fully focused on her core tasks. By developing her leadership skills you will have to spend additional resources. 

This is a dilemma of balancing how you develop your team members, provide sincere feedback and keep the business running.






# Choice
Francisca is a valuable team member and I would hate to see her leave. I sit down with her and ask her in more detail about her motivation to pursue a leadership role. Perhaps there are opportunities for her to stay in my team and take on more informal leadership responsibilities that we haven’t explored yet.

# Feedback
It's good that you are curious about Francisca's development goals and invite her to think about solutions within your team. This could be the best course of action, but you should be prepared that Francisca may still want to leave your team. In that case, think about ways to offer her sincere and constructive feedback and consider how to minimise the impact of her departure on your team's productivity and critical processes. 

This is a dilemma of balancing how you develop your team members, provide sincere feedback and keep the business running.
